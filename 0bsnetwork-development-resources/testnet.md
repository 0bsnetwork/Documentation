# Testnet

0bsnetwork Testnet is a playground to explore and try out various aspects of the platform's functionality. Feel free to create your account/wallet, buy and sell any coins on the built-in exchange, create your own coins, send and receive coins, etc. using the provided web client. And if you're well versed in JavaScript, Java or Python, you can do so much more - using the provided libraries, you can test the platform with data transactions, develop your own user interfaces, apps and solutions on top of the 0bsnetwork blockchain. You can also easily start your own node on the network and participate in processing transactions, if you enable mining and have enough coins to stake on your node.   


**Please Note:** 0bsnetwork Testnet is for testing purposes only and has no real world value whatsoever!   
All tokens, transactions and data you create on the test net might disappear at any moment. Do not attempt to connect any real world value to the test net in any way, as it will definitely be lost.

#### End-user Web Client/Wallet

This is the quickest and easiest way for you to create an account \(wallet\) on the 0bsnetwork TestNet, send and receive, exchange or create coins. Don't forget to backup your Seed Phrase - it's the only way for you to access your wallet. If you loose the seed phrase, you've lost all your funds and noone can restore them for you.

#### Testnet Coin Faucet

In order to use any of the features of the web client, as well as in order to be able to test your own code that uses the functionality of the 0bsnetwork testnet, you'll need some coins, to cover the network fees. Since this is the testnet, you can get the coins for free, using the coin faucet available here:

**Testnet Block Explorer**

Block explorer enables you to see the current version of the software powering the network, see the current block height, browse individual blocks forged by the nodes, as well as their contents, see active nodes on the 0bsnetwork Testnet, etc. You can also access the Testnet Faucet.

#### Testnet Node Software on GitHub. 

You can install the node software and run it as a service on any Debian-based GNU/Linux OS \(Ubuntu, Linux Mint, etc.\), or you can download and run the Java version, for any desktop operating system and run it as an application, as an when you need it. You'll need to edit the testnet.conf configuration file, but it's actually really simple to do. Just follow the instructions and comments provided in the readme file and in the testnet.conf file itself.

**Node API Swagger Interface** 

Node API, with all of the built-in features of the 0bsnetwork Testnet, is made available to you in an easy to understand format for developers. You can test most of the GET requests and get updated information on addresses, blocks, etc.
