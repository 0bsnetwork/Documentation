# Libraries

**JavaScript Library** 

We have published the JavaScript library for any mid- to senior-level web developer to be able to develop demos and solutions using the 0bsnetwork platform. The library is well documented, so we believe that you'll be able to develop your test apps within a few hours. Be careful though and keep security in mind; this is something that the provided library won't do instead of you :\) As a general rule, transaction signing should always be done on the local machine and never directly on the node, as that would make the users' private keys vulnerable to attacks.

#### Java Library

If Java is your programming language of choice, you can download and use our ZBS Java library. Same as with the JavaScript and other libraries, be sure to make your code and interactions with the blockchain secure. Never store users' private keys unencrypted, don't send them over the network - sign all transactions locally instead, and generally be mindful of potential abuses of your code. Blockchain is all about self-sovereignty :\)
