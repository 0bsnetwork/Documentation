# Client

0bsnetwork client is the main piece of software for end users to interact with the platform. It provides functionality of coin/token storage, transactions, token creation, exchange, leasing etc. The Client is also referred to as Wallet, and the main reason we dont's simply use the word Wallet to describe it is that it has significantly more features than an average cryptocurrency wallet.

In the coming months, we will be releasing various types of Clients, for the web, desktop and mobile devices \(Android, iOS and KaiOS\).

As 0bsnetwork is a public and open blockchain platform, anyone can build their own software, or build-in some or all of the available features into their existing desktop, web and mobile apps. There's extensive easy to use API available, as well as software development libraries facilitating the interactions with 0bsnetwork for Python, Java, JavaScript, C\#, etc. You don't need to deal with the complexities of the underlying blockchain layer to develop beautiful and functional apps for your users.
