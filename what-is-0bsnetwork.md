# What is 0bsnetwork?

**0bsnetwork** is a blockchain platform designed for **business applications** of the technology, **ease of use** and **mass adoption**. Our motto is **Blockchain For The Real World**. That reflects our firm focus on serving the needs of enterprises, SMEs and startups with real world use cases for tokens and data management in a decentralised and reliable way. 0bsnetwork is a public platform, but can easily be integrated with private blockchain networks for B2B settings, as well as existing ERP systems.

0bsnetwork is a fork of the open source code of the Waves Platform, which itself is based on NXT and Scorex blockchain projects, with an implementation of the Bitcoin-NG protocol for speed and scalability. Bitcoin-NG protocol was developed originally at Cornell University, by Professor Emin GÃ¼n Sirer and his team.
